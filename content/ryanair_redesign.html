&lt;h1&gt;Ryanair Redesign&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;section title="Description"&gt;
	
	As part of the User Interface Design module of my Multimedia degree we were tasked with finding 
	an example of a bad UI and updating it. At the time, Ryanair's online presence looked attrocious 
	so I tried to give it a new modern look. 
	I updated the logo (big up Harabara!) and did a mock up of a potential new homepage.
	Ryanair has since updated and done a FAR better job, but I thought my design was nice at the time :)
