&lt;h1&gt;Pokémon Battler&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;section title="Description"&gt;
	
	This was my first ever proper programming project from over 7 years ago; 
	A very simple pokémon battler game modeled on the amazing gameboy games. 
	The code is extremely simple with plenty of programming faux pas, 
	but it's nice to look back on every once in a while to see how far I've come.
