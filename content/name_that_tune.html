&lt;h1&gt;Name that Tune&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;section title="Description"&gt;
	
	Created for an assignment during my time at the Code Institute, Name that Tune is a fun 
	guess the song game which consumes Spotify's public API. The idea for the game came 
	after finding out the API was limited to 30 secs of playback. 
	The project was created from concept to finished product in just 3 days and coded using AngularJS.
	I created the graphical assets in Photoshop.
