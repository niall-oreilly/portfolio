&#x3C;section title=&#x22;About Me&#x22;&#x3E;
    I&#x27;ve been passionate about programming since I wrote my first line of code over 10 years ago.
    Studying digital media in university allowed me to explore my creativity and has given me a flare for 
    design and innovation that has been fundamental throughout my career. 
    I've been creating media since I first got my hands on a PC; 
    be it filming short movies as a kid or producing and selling my own music as a teenager. 
    The world of front-end is a natural fit, which allows me express my creative side and excites me with it&#x27;s blistering rate of change. 
&#x3C;/section&#x3E;

&#x3C;section title=&#x22;What I do&#x22;&#x3E;
    I develop rich user interfaces and interactive experiences. 
    Most recently I am working with Deputy, one of Australia's fastest growing tech companies as part of multidisciplinary squads across Growth and Marketing. 
    From leading technical projects such as our low-touch onboarding Learning Centre to leading our in-house A/B Testing and CRO engineering efforts, 
    my focus is always on having empathy for the user.
