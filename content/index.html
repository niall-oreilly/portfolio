&#x3C;section title=&#x22;About Me&#x22;&#x3E;
    I&#x27;ve been passionate about programming since I wrote my first line of code seven years ago.
    Studying digital media in university allowed me to explore my creativity and has given me a flare for 
    design and innovation that has been fundamental throughout my career. 
    I've been creating media since I first got my hands on a PC; 
    be it filming short movies as a kid or producing and selling my own music as a teenager. 
    The front end is a natural progression, which allows me express my creative side and excites me with it&#x27;s blistering rate of change.

&#x3C;section title=&#x22;What I do&#x22;&#x3E;
    I develop rich user interfaces and interactive experiences. 
    Most recently I was working with Fusioneer Software, creator of SportsInteraction.com, one of Canada&#x27;s leading sports websites.
    As part of an agile team, my role demanded that I work closely with the UX department to bring pixel perfect UI concepts to life. 
    I have a keen interest in dynamic web apps, sharp animation and new tech standards. 
    I love finding new solutions to old problems and making the user&#x27;s experience delightful.
