&lt;h1&gt;3e Sting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;section title="Description"&gt;
	
	As part of the 3D Animation module of my Multimedia degree we were tasked with creating a
	fresh TV sting for the channel 3e. We had to take into account the youthful audience of the channel 
	and produce something to suit. 
	I decided on an abstract urban/grungy style to convey that the channel was targeted at younger people
	and created a harsh dubstep audio track in FL Sudio to fit with that aesthetic.
	The CGI was rendered in Cinema4D with post production done in After Effects.
	The finished sting can be seen on youtube: [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZhbE2wJpQk ]
