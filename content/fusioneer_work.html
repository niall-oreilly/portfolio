&lt;h1&gt;Fusioneer Work&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;section title="Live Betting Overview Page"&gt;

	&lt;p title="Description"&gt;
		One of my favorite projects I've worked on at Fusioneer is the overview page for our live betting application. 
		This Ember app receives real-time betting info and price changes from our Rails back end and allows the user to
		bet on multiple games at the same time while giving instant feedback. 
		I worked very closely with our lead designer (he sits 5 feet away) to bring his vision to life and added my
		own flourishes such as designing the elastic motion for the animated tabs and expandable panels.

&lt;section title="Sports Interaction Desktop Homepage Redesign"&gt;

	&lt;p title="Description"&gt;
		I played a major role in the development of the new and improved homepage of the desktop site. 
		The previous update to the homepage had been in 2011 and the site was beginning to look dated. 
		The new update brought with it a fresh skeuminimal design and some motion elements along with a set of 
		new standard elements such as custom dropdowns, new link styles etc. 
		I worked back and forth with the designers to help bring about this update. 
		The results can be seen in the center column at [ https://www.sportsinteraction.com ]
