&lt;h1&gt;Fusioneer Work (Sports Interaction)&lt;/h1&gt; [ https://www.sportsinteraction.com/ ]

&lt;p title="Overview" &gt;
	I worked as part of an agile team of 15 - 20 developers on a large-scale codebase.
	We were divided into cross functional teams and used a modern workflow, deploying to production
	dozens of times per day. My role was working closely with the UX dept to conceptualize and develop 
	new features and reusable UI components.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;section title="Delighting the user"&gt;

	&lt;p title="Description"&gt;
		While at Fusioneer, I became a champion of CSS animation and micro-interactions on our site. 
		Many of the design guidelines and mockups when I arrived contained only one state and no guidelines
		for how the design would be interacted with. This allowed me to coordinate and add my own animation 
		and interaction states which I enjoyed. The UX team was very impressed with the flourishes and motion 
		I was adding to the designs so we formalised a process of consultation about animation and state changes 
		and now all design guides include these. The site feels a lot more modern and dynamic as a result.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;section title="Desktop Site Responsiveness"&gt;

	&lt;p title="Description"&gt;
		Our CEO noticed that all of our competitors sites filled more of his desktop screen when he visited. 
		This was because our classic three column site layout had a fixed width of 960px and hadn’t been updated in over a decade. 
		This was set as a top priority for the Front End team to fix in a timely manner. All the solutions put forward such as creating 
		a full responsive from mobile to desktop site would be too time consuming. I put forward an idea and championed a 
		Respo-Medium™ (patent pending ;)) site. The site would retain it’s layout but be responsive between 720px and 1280px. 
		I played a massive role in helping the UX team understand how this would work and in implementing this solution. 
		Me and another developer managed to completely overhaul the whole site using flex layouts and responsive design in only 
		4 weeks using this method.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;section title="Progressive Web App"&gt;

	&lt;p title="Description"&gt;
		After reading a lot about PWAs and their many benefits and few drawbacks in terms of time needed to implement, 
		I pushed for our mobile site to be converted to a progressive web app. After putting together a tech demo in a couple of hours 
		and showing our head of engineering they were very excited as the company had been thinking about developing a 
		hybrid mobile application for the app stores. I implemented the initial stages of the PWA while at the company 
		and there was talk of adding push notifications and more complex functionality later.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section title="VueJS Introduction"&gt;

	&lt;p title="Description"&gt;
		I was a proponent of Vue being brought in for use across our site as our main JS library. 
		Because of it’s modularity we could convert the site piece by piece without affecting other components on the page. 
		Me and another developer conducted a feasibility study by converting our Live-Betting app to Vue and found it to be 
		very easy to use. Before leaving the company I was moved to a project to port over our line managers’ real-time odds 
		manipulation software from React to Vue so it was in line with the rest of the site.

	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;section title="Front End Build Process"&gt;

	&lt;p title="Description"&gt;
		While at Fusioneer I noticed many problems and bottlenecks in our front end build system. 
		One of the main problems was an old YUI compressor java applet which needed to be ran through opening your web browser
		and hitting a local url; a step many people forgot to do before deploying, thus breaking the site. 
		I automated this step by adding it to the gulp task using phantomJS. Later this same JS compressor had problems with 
		compiling ES6+ code so I replaced it completely with webpack. I also decreased runtime by having certain tasks run concurrently. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
