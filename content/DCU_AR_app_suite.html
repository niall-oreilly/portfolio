<h1>DCU AR App Suite</h1>

<section title="Description">

	I was selected to be part of a scholarship group that was asked to work with the Learning Innovation Unit at DCU
	to explore the applications of Augmented Reality technology for use in teaching within the college. 
	The task was to create a suite of mobile apps that varied across schools and departments 
	to aid students in their studies. 
	The apps we created were: 
	<ul>
		<li>An interactive brochure for the library including info, videos, and an interactive image-tracking 3D map.</li>
		<li>A nursing and medical app including interactive health posters with videos showing students how to use 
			medical equipment and take readings from patients.</li>
		<li>A biotechnology app which recognised machines in the lab and displayed usage info, animated diagrams etc.</li>
	</ul>

	Myself and a co-developer used the Layar SDK along with XCode and Android Studio to create in total, 6 apps. 
	We developed the user interface using HTML, CSS &amp; JS.

<section title="Outcome">

	The project as a whole was a huge success. 
	We showcased the apps to lecturers and industry professionals at the President's Teaching Awards 
	and the project itself received the President's Award for Innovation in 2014.
	The apps were never released to the public but you can take a look below:
