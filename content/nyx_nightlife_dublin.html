&lt;h1&gt;Nyx Nightlife Dublin&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;section title="Description"&gt;
		
	This was the thesis project for my BSc in Multimedia. 
	Myself and my group took on the task of launching a nightlife event guide brand and app in just three months. 
	The launch included a full length video advertisement and social media presence. 
	The app itself, which I was the sole developer of, was based around automatically gathering events from nightclub promoter/venue 
	Facebook pages using the graph API and scraping data from the descriptions. 
	Users could log in to save favourite venues or share events on Facebook and twitter. 
	There was an Event view, Venue view and Map view featuring events up to months in advance including age requirements and entry prices. 
	I developed the app using the LAMP stack with a PhoneGap based UI. 
	I also got involved in the video production, creating the audio track from scratch and editing the demo video.

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section title="Outcome"&gt;

	We received a first class honours grade for the project. 
	Not only that, but the app was well received by the public, getting over 900 downloads and over 1,000 likes on Facebook. 
	The app has since been retired but you can view other content here:
