<h1>CPD Sessions Work</h1>

<p title="Description">
	My previous employer was CPD Sessions, one of the leading e-learning content providers for medical professionals in Ireland. I was employed as the company's first in house developer after previously outsourcing. As the only developer, my job was extremely varied and I had to adapt to suit the role that was required of me that day. I attended initial meetings with clients, talked through the feasibility of their ideas and gathered requirements. I then worked directly with the clients to deliver the functionality they wanted. All of the sites I created while at CPD Sessions needed to be responsive.
	A couple of the many sites I developed are below:

	The Irish College of GPs Educational Portal: [ http://www.icgp-education.com ]
	The Irish Practice Nurses Association: [ http://www.irishpracticenurses.ie ]
