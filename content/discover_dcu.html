<h1>Discover DCU</h1>

<section title="Description">
	
	After the success of our work with the Learning Innovation Unit at DCU, the Comms and Marketing Department employed myself 
	and two of the designers from the group to develop a virtual tour guide of the campus for the next open day. 
	I used PhoneGap and jQuery mobile to develop the cross platform app which consisted of a geo-fenced, 
	map-based tour with points of interest showing up in succession as the user reached the previous stop. 
	There was also social media integration with Twitter and Facebook to share your tour with friends.
	The app has since been taken down but you can see some screenshots here:
